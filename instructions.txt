# This project is built with Vue 3. 
To run the app locally, you need to have Node installed as it requires a NodeJS static file server.
I have already built the project so it does not require Vue CLI. 

Step 1: 
After pulling the project files from Git repository, cd into its root directory (i.e. gcn)

Step 2:
Now, cd into "dist" folder that contains all dependencies and files. 

Step 3:
Run the folloing command "npm install -g serve" this will install node modules.

Step 4: 
cd back to root directory and run "serve -s dist", this will start the Node server and you will be able to
run the app on local server (most likely http://localhost:3000).

Note: To run the app in dev mode, please install Vue cli and run the following commands:
npm install
npm run serve
